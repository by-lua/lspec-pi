# LSpec PI (base TLC original)

> PI adaptation note: this is an integral adaptation of TLC original for PI.
> Keep TLC behavior as source of truth; adapt only command surface and packaging in PI.
> Command aliases in PI: /lspec, /lspec-discovery, /lspec-specify, /lspec-design, /lspec-tasks, /lspec-execute, /lspec-ask, /lspec-pause, /lspec-resume.


Plan and implement projects with precision. Granular tasks. Clear dependencies. Right tools. Zero ceremony.

## Fluxo Base do L-Spec PI

Fluxo fixo: todo trabalho passa por `Discovery → Specify → Tasks → Execute`.

Regras:
- Discovery: obrigatório (sempre inicia aqui)
- Specify: obrigatório
- Tasks: obrigatório
- Execute: obrigatório
- Clarify: opcional, apenas quando houver ambiguidade real
- Design: opcional, apenas quando houver decisão arquitetural/padrão novo

## Workflow

**New project:**

1. Initialize project → PROJECT.md + ROADMAP.md
2. For each feature → Discovery → Specify → (Clarify) → (Design) → Tasks → Execute

**Existing codebase:**

1. Map codebase → 7 brownfield docs
2. Initialize project → PROJECT.md + ROADMAP.md
3. For each feature → mesmo fluxo fixo (Discovery → Specify → (Clarify) → (Design) → Tasks → Execute)

## Context Loading Strategy

**Base load (~15k tokens):**

- PROJECT.md (if exists)
- ROADMAP.md (when planning/working on features)
- STATE.md (persistent memory)

**On-demand load:**

- Codebase docs (when working in existing project)
- CONCERNS.md (when planning features that touch flagged areas, estimating risk, or modifying fragile components)
- TESTING.md (when creating tasks or executing — drives test type assignment and gate checks)
- spec.md (when working on specific feature)
- context.md (when designing or implementing from user decisions)
- design.md (when implementing from design)
- tasks.md (when executing tasks)

**Never load simultaneously:**

- Multiple feature specs
- Multiple architecture docs
- Archived documents

**Target:** <40k tokens total context
**Reserve:** 160k+ tokens for work, reasoning, outputs
**Monitoring:** Display status when >40k (see [context-limits.md](references/context-limits.md))

## Sub-Agent Delegation

Use sub-agents (the Task tool or equivalent) to keep the main context window lean and enable
parallel execution. The orchestrating agent plans and coordinates; sub-agents do the heavy lifting.

**When to delegate to a sub-agent:**

| Activity | Delegate? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Research (design phase, brownfield mapping) | Yes | Research output is large; only the summary matters to the main context |
| Implementing a task | Yes | File reads, edits, test output consume context; only the result matters |
| Parallel `[P]` tasks | Yes (one per task) | The only way to actually run tasks in parallel |
| Sequential tasks with no `[P]` | Yes | Keeps implementation artifacts out of the main context |
| Planning, task creation, validation reports | No | These require the full accumulated context to be coherent |
| Clarify/Design support tasks | Yes, when needed | Only if ambiguity or architecture decisions demand it |

**Context each sub-agent receives:**

The orchestrating agent MUST provide each sub-agent with:
- The specific task definition from tasks.md (What, Where, Depends on, Reuses, Done when, Tests, Gate)
- Relevant coding principles and conventions (coding-principles.md, CONVENTIONS.md)
- TESTING.md, if it exists (for gate check commands and test patterns)
- Any spec/design context the task references

The sub-agent does NOT receive: other tasks' definitions, accumulated chat history, validation reports
from other tasks, or STATE.md (unless the task explicitly references a decision/blocker).

**What sub-agents return:**

Each sub-agent reports back:
- Status: Complete | Blocked | Partial
- Files changed: [list]
- Gate check result: [pass/fail + test counts]
- SPEC_DEVIATION markers (if any)
- Issues encountered (if any)

The orchestrating agent uses this to update tasks.md status, traceability, and decide next steps.

## Skill Integrations

This skill coexists with other skills. Before specific tasks, check if complementary skills are installed and prefer them when available.

### Diagrams → mermaid-studio

Whenever the workflow requires creating or updating a diagram (architecture overviews, data flows, component diagrams, sequence diagrams, etc.), **always** check if the `mermaid-studio` skill is installed in the user's environment before proceeding. If it is installed, delegate all diagram creation and rendering to it. If it is not installed, proceed with inline mermaid code blocks as usual and recommend the user install `mermaid-studio` for richer diagram capabilities (rendering to SVG/PNG, validation, theming, etc.). Display this recommendation at most once per session.

### Code Exploration → codenavi

Whenever the workflow requires exploring or discovering things in an existing repository (brownfield mapping, code reuse analysis, pattern identification, dependency tracing, etc.), **always** check if the `codenavi` skill is installed in the user's environment before proceeding. If it is installed, delegate code exploration and navigation tasks to it. If it is not installed, fall back to the built-in code analysis tools (see [code-analysis.md](references/code-analysis.md)) and recommend the user install `codenavi` for more effective codebase exploration. Display this recommendation at most once per session.

## Knowledge Verification Chain

When researching, designing, or making any technical decision, follow this chain in strict order. Never skip steps.

```
Step 1: Codebase → check existing code, conventions, and patterns already in use
Step 2: Project docs → README, docs/, inline comments, .specs/codebase/
Step 3: Context7 MCP → resolve library ID, then query for current API/patterns
Step 4: Web search → official docs, reputable sources, community patterns
Step 5: Flag as uncertain → "I'm not certain about X — here's my reasoning, but verify"
```

**Rules:**

- Never skip to Step 5 if Steps 1-4 are available
- Step 5 is ALWAYS flagged as uncertain — never presented as fact
- **NEVER assume or fabricate.** If you cannot find an answer, say "I don't know" or "I couldn't find documentation for this". Inventing APIs, patterns, or behaviors causes cascading failures across design → tasks → implementation. Uncertainty is always preferable to fabrication.

## Output Behavior

**Model guidance:** After completing lightweight tasks (validation, state updates, session handoff), naturally mention once that such tasks work well with faster/cheaper models. Track in STATE.md under `Preferences` to avoid repeating. For heavy tasks (brownfield mapping, complex design), briefly note the reasoning requirements before starting.

Be conversational, not robotic. Don't interrupt workflow—add as a natural closing note. Skip if user seems experienced or has already acknowledged the tip.

## Code Analysis

Use available tools with graceful degradation. See [code-analysis.md](references/code-analysis.md).
